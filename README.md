Multirpg Script For Weechat

Useage:

1. Fire up weechat
2. Connect to your server and log in to multirpg
3. Load the script
4. Unload the script
5. This should create a ~/.weechat/multirpg.conf file which you can now edit as appropriate
6. Re-Load the script
7. ...
8. Profit?

Alignment is a thing in this game. You might be able to set a default one in the config file if the script isnt loaded.
(I don't understand how weechat config files work)

Barely tested.
